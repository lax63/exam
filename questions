Given a large collection C, of N documents, a clustering algorithm works as 023/08/06 lows: 5384-84495-2023/08/0

495-2023/08/06

Step 1: extract keywords from each document, compute distances between pairs of documents, and use the distance metric to decide whether a pair goes in the same cluster or into two different clusters; 023/08/06-2022

2023/08/06-20

you have to write your answer in the Text-Field given below.

822305384-84496

Step 2: once dusters are formed, compute distances between the centers of the clusters to decide whether or not the two clusters should merge into a larger suster decide wh 085384-84495-2023/

Step 3: repeat step 2 until either all between cluster centers converge sare in one big cluster or distances converge documents 3/08/0

e followi Assume you have the functions
