It is given that for two i defined as follows: x and y, the cost function C(x, y) is defined as follows

If x <y, C(x, y) = x.
Otherwise, C(x, y) = C(x/y, y) +x MOD y.

You have been given two integres x and c, such that C(x, y) = c, for some y

Find the smallest value of y, which satisfies the above defined cost function. If no such y exists return -1.

Note: It is given that 2 <= y <= (2*10^9)
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, x, denoting the given integer x
The next line contains an integer c, denoting the value c described in the problem.
