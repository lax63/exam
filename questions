Feature probability distribution of two classes of 2-dimensional data points  are given by
P(x,y | 〖class〗_0) = 1/(2πσ_x σ_y )exp[〖-(x-1)〗^2/(2σ_x^2 )- y^2/(〖2σ〗_y^2 )]
And
P(x,y | 〖class〗_1) = 1/(2πσ_x σ_y )exp[〖-(x)〗^2/(2σ_y^2 )- ((〖y-2)〗^2)/(〖2σ〗_x^2 )]

P(〖class〗_0)=0.4, p(〖class〗_1)=0.6
i)Derive the equation of decision boundary assuming Naïve Bayes assumption.
ii) what is the equation and shape of the decision boundary if σ_x  = σ_y= σ? Draw the decision boundary clearly showing which region belongs to class0 and class1. Is the decision boundary linear?


ii) what is the equation and shape of the decision boundary if σ_x  =2σ_y? Draw the decision boundary clearly showing which region belongs to class0 and class1. Is the decision boundary linear?
