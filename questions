Consider the following equation for gradient descent:

WW-18(L, D, w)

(where g is the gradient function, L the loss ss function, and 6-2022aa05384-84495-2 and D, the dataset and denotes

the learning rate)

for i = 1 to 08/06-2022aam_iter

shuffle (data);

for example in data {

grad = eval_gradient (loss_function, example,

and the corresponding pseudo-code for stochastic gradient descent: 1495-2023/08/06-222aa05384-8449

3/06-

W=w-learning_rate* grad;

Can the inner loop be implemented as a software pipeline? Why or why not? 84-84495-2023/08/2022aa05384-84 20228805384

If the inner loop is implemented as a software pipeline, explain the cost overhead in running
this implementation on a distributed system as opposed to a shared memory system
