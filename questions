Drawback of term document matrix:

One drawback of term document matrix is that it does not take into account the order of words in a document. This means that two documents that contain the same words, but in different order, will be considered to be similar. For example, Doc 1 and Doc 2 both contain the words "spa" and "massage", but in different order. This means that they will be considered to be similar, even though they may be about different things.

TF-IDF to identify informative word for doc 4:

TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. It is a weighting scheme that is used to measure the importance of a word in a document. The TF-IDF score for a word is calculated as follows:

Term Frequency (TF): This is the number of times a word appears in a document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): This is the logarithm of the number of documents in a corpus divided by the number of documents that contain the word.
The TF-IDF score for a word is a measure of how important the word is in a document, relative to other documents in the corpus. The higher the TF-IDF score, the more important the word is considered to be.

In the given term document matrix, the word with the highest TF-IDF score for Doc 4 is Apple. This suggests that the word Apple is the most informative word in Doc 4.

Here is the calculation of the TF-IDF score for the word Apple in Doc 4:

Term Frequency (TF): 26
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): log(4 / 2) = log(2)
TF-IDF score = 26 * log(2) = 52

Therefore, the word Apple has a TF-IDF score of 52, which is the highest TF-IDF score for any word in Doc 4. This suggests that the word Apple is the most informative word in Doc 4.
