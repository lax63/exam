SECTION B (4 marks)
Everybody loves the treasure hunt game be it in real life or in a digital form. Suppose that there is 
a ForestGrid and one player who has to start his hunt from an initial position in the grid and to 
reach to the last grid of the ForestGrid to obtain the treasure. But unfortunately, there are certain 
obstacles coming his way which will lead him to a different grid rather than following an optimal 
path to reach near the treasure. The obstacles could be a wild animal or an end point in the forest 
which will get discovered later after reaching that point. For the player to reach the treasure he will 
have to avoid the grid containing wild animals and take another optimal move than the current 
one. In the scenario where the end point arrives the player will have to take 2 steps backward and 
find an optimal move to start his hunt.
Grid with animal - probability of getting killed is 0.8, that means there is probability of reaching 

to treasure is 0.2.

End point - works as a barrier/wall on either side of the grid. Suppose the endpoint is on the east 

side of the grid, then this signifies that the player cannot go to the right side of the current grid.

SafeGrid - grid with no animal. Reward will be -1. 

The player can move left, right, up and down to reach the treasure.

Given below is the scenario map. Create a 8X8 grid with the position of animals, treasure, start 

point and the end point/barrier as given below.

1) Find the optimal policy for the above scenario value iteration and policy iteration

2) Analyze which of the two is better suited for the scenario in terms of convergence
