Consider the following equation for gradient descent:

w = w â€“ n*g(L, D, w)

(where g is the gradient function, L the loss ss function, and D, the dataset and n denotes
the learning rate)
and the corresponding pseudo-code for stochastic gradient descent
for i = 1 to num_iter{
shuffle (data);
for example in data {
grad = eval_gradient (loss_function, example,w);
w=w - learning_rate* grad;
 }
}
Can the inner loop be implemented as a software pipeline? Why or why not? 
If the inner loop is implemented as a software pipeline, explain the cost overhead in running
this implementation on a distributed system as opposed to a shared memory system
