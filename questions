A student in MTech datascience was revising Linear Algebra for his end semester exam. Then he came 
across a 3 by 3 matrix named G in a linear algebra textbook. 202

G= 27

where is an unknown real number. His friend named Al then asked him the following questions about this matrix :
(a) For which possible values of parameter, can we be sure that the matrix G will only have non-zero eigenvalues. 
(b) If all the eigenvalues of G are known to be positive then what is the possible range of values that parameter can take.
Derive answer to the questions asked by Al.

Let the vector f=2x+2x1 x2+3x-2. Calculate the gradient of f and find a point where it vanishes, if there exists such a point. [3 Marks]

Can the function f(x) = 1+2x+3x²/2 be the Taylor's series expansion to three terms for a function of the form e+ around = 0? If so, 2 find a and 3. Otherwise, explain why the given polynomial cannot be a Taylor series expansion of a function of the form ex+?
