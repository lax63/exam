where is an unknown real number. His friend named Al then asked him the following questions about this matrix : (a) For which possible values of parameter, can we be sure that the

matrix G will only have non-zero eigenvalues. (b) If all the eigenvalues of G are known to be positive then what is the possible range of values that parameter can take. Derive answer to the questions asked by Al.
