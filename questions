Consider the training phase of bagging (or bootstrap aggregation) parallelized on a multi-core system with m bootstrap samples: -
Will it affect the system performance parameters (not machine learning performance attributes like accuracy) if (i) a different bootstrap (or selection) technique is used for each sample or (ii) a different learning algorithm is used for each sample or both (i) and (ii)?  Explain your answer.
