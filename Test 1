You are given two integers N and K. You will also be given an array A of length N.
The Value of gcd(b) (where b is a subsequence) is equal to the greatest common divisor of all its elements.
We say that a sequence b is good sequence if : 
1.	b is a subsequence of A
2.	b is increasing. This means that for each index i  such that (i>0), b[i] > b[i-1].
3.	gcd(b,K) > 1 (the GCD of that sequence with K is greater than 1).

Find the maximum possible length of a good sequence in A.

Notes:-
A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained from y by deletion of several(possibly, zero, or all) elements.

Input Format
The First line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in A.
The next line contains an integer, K as described in the problem statement.
Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < N) contains an integer describing A[i].

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^5

4
3	
Output : 1	
Explanation
N = 3 K = 2 A =[4,4,3] The longest good sequence is 4, which has a length equal to 1. Hence the answer is 1.

Example 2 :

8	
Output : 2	
Explanation 
N = 4 k = 2 A =[6,4,5,8] The longest good sequence is : 4, 8 which has a length equal to 2. Hence the answer is 2.

Output : 3
Explanation
N = 5 K = 3 A = [3,4,6,8,9] The longest good sequence is : 3 6 9, which has a length equal to 3. Hence the answer is 3.
