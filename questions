consists of multiple levels each being a different challenge but with same reward structure. An episode consists of completing a level. The agent is expected to maximize the Total expected reward as it progresses through the episodes. The computer program is evaluating the following two ways of computing the reward.

	G_t = R_(t+1)+ R_(t+2)+  R_(t+3) + . . . +  R_ϒ
	G_t= R₁+1+ϒR_(t+2)+ ϒ^2 R_(t+3)+   …… 

Which reward function will enable the agent to progress quickly through the episodes and why? Provide your answer in precise terms. (hots if the answer is more than two good statements, you probably get the explanation wrong) 
(b) In the scenario given in the previous part of the question, what will be the return (using ii), if the reward for all the steps is 10, including the terminal states?
