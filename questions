a) Consider a two input XNOR gate and simulate a perceptron algorithm fot it, where, learning rate=0.02 and threshold = 0.2
(b) Represent using a multilayer neural network A δ B δ C δ D δ  E where δ represents XNOR. What will be the optimal depth and width for this network.
(c) You'd like to train a fully-connected neural network with 7 hidden layers each with 8 hidden units. The input is 30-dimensional and the is a binary. What is the total number of trainable parameters in your network.
