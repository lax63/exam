Sure, I can help you with that.

a. Four-gram language model

The four-gram language model for the given training data is as follows:

(what do you) (sell, O ye) vender
(what do you) (weave, O ye) flowergirl
(what do you) (weave, O ye) fisherman
(what do you) (catch, O ye) fisherman
(what do you) (make, O ye) goldsmith
(what do you) (weigh, O ye) vender
(what do you) (weigh, O ye) flowergirl
To predict the next word in the test sentence "What do you make, O ye _________", we can use the four-gram model to calculate the probability of each possible next word. The possible next words are "vendor" and "goldsmith". The probabilities of these two words are as follows:

Probability of "vendor" = (1 + 10) / (7 + 10 * 6) = 11 / 66 = 1 / 6
Probability of "goldsmith" = (1 + 10) / (7 + 10 * 6) = 11 / 66 = 1 / 6
Therefore, the four-gram language model predicts that the next word in the test sentence is "vendor" with a probability of 1 / 6 and "goldsmith" with a probability of 1 / 6.

b. Five-gram language model

The five-gram language model for the given training data is as follows:

(what do you) (sell, O ye) (vender)
(what do you) (weave, O ye) (flowergirl)
(what do you) (weave, O ye) (fisherman)
(what do you) (catch, O ye) (fisherman)
(what do you) (make, O ye) (goldsmith)
(what do you) (weigh, O ye) (vender)
(what do you) (weigh, O ye) (flowergirl)
To predict the next word in the test sentence "What do you make, O ye _________", we can use the five-gram model to calculate the probability of each possible next word. The possible next words are "vendor" and "goldsmith". The probabilities of these two words are as follows:

Probability of "vendor" = (1 + 10) / (7 + 10 * 5) = 11 / 35
Probability of "goldsmith" = (1 + 10) / (7 + 10 * 5) = 11 / 35
Therefore, the five-gram language model predicts that the next word in the test sentence is "vendor" with a probability of 11 / 35 and "goldsmith" with a probability of 11 / 35.

c. Perplexity

The perplexity of a language model is a measure of how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence. A lower perplexity indicates that the model is better at predicting the next word.

The perplexity of the four-gram language model for the test sentence is calculated as follows:

Perplexity = 2 ^ (-1 / 6) = 2.125
The perplexity of the five-gram language model for the test sentence is calculated as follows:

Perplexity = 2 ^ (-11 / 35) = 1.818
Therefore, the five-gram language model has a lower perplexity than the four-gram language model, which indicates that the five-gram language model is better at predicting the next word in the test sentence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
