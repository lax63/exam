You will be given an array A of size N.

Find the number of sub-sequence(not neccessarily of consecutive elements) that meet the folloeing conditions:
    If the elemnts x appears in the sub-sequence, then all appearences of x are consecutives in the taken  sub-sequence.
    Two sub-sequence x, Y are different if there is an index i that is taken in X but not in Y, or taken in Y not taken in X.

    Return the answer modulo 998244353

    Input Format

    The first line contains an integer, N denoting the number of elements in A.
    Each line i of the N subsequence lines (where 0<=i < N) contains an integer describing A[i];
